# Votr
Votr is a proof-of-concept for a secure and accessible online election which utilizes blockchain technology to maintain an immutable and anonymous record of verified ballots.
Votr was a project submission for Georgia Tech's 2021 HackGT Hackathon and won 3rd place in the NSA Secure Code challenge.

Votr models the process of a blockchain election by utilizing python to implement a blockchain mechanism which stores online ballot data. Users are able to view the blockchain, cast a vote if they are registered, and lookup the record of their ballots through their block number containing their transaction. After a voter votes, their voter hash is removed from the registered voters, and added to a blacklisted voter hash collection in order to prevent voting more than once.

## Setup

``` 
4. Create a React Build by running
```
npm run build
```
5. Go to [localhost:8000](localhost:8000) to access the client side web app.
